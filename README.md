This repository demonstrates a race condition in PHP code involving a counter increment. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a solution using atomic operations to avoid the race condition.  The race condition occurs when multiple processes or threads try to increment the counter simultaneously. Without proper synchronization, the final count may be less than expected due to the non-atomic nature of the increment operation. The solution uses appropriate synchronization mechanisms to guarantee accurate counting even under concurrent access.
