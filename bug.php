This code suffers from a race condition.  If two processes try to increment the counter simultaneously, the final value may be lower than expected because the increment operation is not atomic. In a multithreaded environment, this could lead to inaccurate results.  The `$counter` variable is accessed and modified concurrently without proper synchronization.
